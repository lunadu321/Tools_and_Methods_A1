# Project: Film Genre Preferences Across Cultures

## Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze genre preferences in films across different cultures. The investigation will delve into whether and how cultural factors influence audience preferences for specific film genres. By examining existing research and developing quantitative analysis, the project seeks to identify trends, variations, and potential cultural influences on genre choices.

## Background

I am particularly interested in movies and how they are percieved in different cultures. Existing research in film studies has already explored cultural influences on audience reception and genre preferences. For example, by analyzing data from movie review website and box office revenue, [Chiu et al (2019)](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IMR-06-2018-0190/full/html) found that Chinese audience are not as interested in comedy and drama as American. Following their approach, I want to see how audiences across the world might have different genre preferences.
